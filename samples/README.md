This directory contains samples we test scenarios and features with.

All samples use the Boot starter, have integration tests you can run or debug, and expose a GraphiQL page to try queries with. Simply start the `main` application class and go to http://localhost:8080/graphiql. 

To run from the command line, use:
```shell script
$ ./gradlew :samples:{sample-directory-name}:bootRun
```
